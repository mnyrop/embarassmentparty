      <h4>curatorial statement:</h4>

      <p>
        isn&rsquo;t it time to rename the internet? isn&rsquo;t the web 2.0 more
        of a cloud for falling than a net for catching? the internet&rsquo;s
        external inter-connections have been wholly consumed&mdash;internalized
        and made mobile. the cloud is always simultaneously here&mdash;in our
        local drives, intuitively integrated with our bodies and preeminently
        available to them&mdash;and way over there&mdash;on servers far away, in
        metaphors up in the air, and peripheral to individual comprehension or
        control. we ask: what does this remote intimacy of the cloud imply? and
        what does it obscure?
      </p>

      <p>
        with the emergence of the cloud, connections of time and space have
        fractalized, becoming too many and too arbitrary and too deep. our
        actions have become porous, complicit and confused via social plugins,
        multinational investors, &rsquo;friends of friends,&lsquo; conspicuous
        absences and inferred consensus. we click here and a server in texas
        compliments our labor with its own; we click there and an advertising
        agency cashes in; we click here and our photos become the property of
        something or someone else (we don&rsquo;t know); we click there and our
        contact lists are spammed; no one clicks and we delete our content over
        the unsettling lack of response. we are queasy with oscillations of here
        and far, near and where.
      </p>

      <p>
        much more than the servers, routers, cables, and agreements to terms of
        service that comprise it, we know the cloud to be a precarious factory
        and a nauseous feeling. we also know it to be a medium through which
        resistance, eagerness, and generative forms of embarrassment can still
        materialize. if the cloud can no longer be extricated from protocols of
        social, political, economic, and emotional life, we hope that this
        installation might inform a more empathetic future for those who will
        have been uploaded into it.

      <h4>embarrassment_party_virtual_residency:</h4>
      <h6>by marii_nyr&ouml;p</h6>

      <p>
        in november 2013, i released an open call online for artists and
        theorists to apply to the embarrassment_party virtual residency program.
        i purchased the domain embarrassmentparty.biz and the email address
        maestro@embarrassmentparty.biz, and from then on operated as &quot;the
        maestro&quot; of the e_p project. in the following weeks, over 50
        applications were received and the website was viewed by several hundred
        visitors from 32 different nation states. applicants were asked to
        submit responses in any medium to the project&rsquo;s initial themes,
        including remote intimacies, cloud capital, over exposure, data labor,
        and free fall in the cloud.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 130px">
        by january 2014, seven artists were welcomed into the project (the
        eighth being myself/the maestro), and the residency officially began in
        early february. since that time, we have chatted extensively as a group
        and in smaller clusters about ideas, sources of excitement, and sites of
        anxiety. few of us have met each other in person. this did not impede
        collaboration, but certainly informed and transformed our creative,
        collective practices. even though the residency has culminated in the
        embarrassment_party irl + url installation, the residency will not end
        now. for better or worse, the cloud does not close unless we close
        ourselves to it. however, emilio vavarella&quot;s theft of
        embarrassment_party in its entirety within his creative commons concept
        piece <i>the italian job</i> has left the future of the project
        precarious and foggy, much like the cloud in general. any other
        iterations of e_p would be illegal, but whatever&hellip;?
